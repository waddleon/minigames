## Why Godot?

When I first thought of the concept my original plan was to build it from the ground up.  
But after a bit of thinking, I decided that using a game engine might allow me to keep my sanity in tack & Godot ticks all the requirments.  

Not only that but by using a game engine like Godot lowers the skill barrier for other users to make custom mods for the game.
