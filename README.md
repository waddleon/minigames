# ![text][logo] Club Penguin Minigames

Port of all the classic Club Penguin minigames from flash to Godot.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current plan is mostly to focus on the single player, though perhaps local multiplayer for some of the game modes is something I will look into.

## Why did this start?

In recent years Club Penguin private servers have become a bit of a nightmare, espically in terms of longevity. A server will appear and then be gone just as quickly as it arrived. This has led to making it harder to invest in a server with the fear of it being gone by the next time they try to log on.

Though I for the most part have come to terms with this, I have realised that most of the time I'm only playing for the minigames anyway. So I thought why not just have a local collection of the games that I can always play *(until I dunno disney sues me or somethin)* and sure I could simply run a local flash player but what is the fun of that.

## Why Godot?

When I first thought of the concept my original plan was to build it from the ground up.  
But after a bit of thinking, I decided that using a game engine might allow me to keep my sanity in tack & Godot ticks all the requirments.  

Not only that but by using a game engine like Godot lowers the skill barrier for other users to make custom mods for the game.
