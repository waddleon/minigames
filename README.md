# ![text][logo] Club Penguin Minigames

Port of all the classic Club Penguin minigames from flash to Godot.

## Why Godot?

When I first thought of the concept my original plan was to build it from the ground up.
But after a bit of thinking, I decided that using a game engine might allow me to keep my sanity in tack & Godot ticks all the requirments.
